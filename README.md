The Happiest State in the U.S has the highest life expectancy.

For this project, I took two data sets and overlaid the two to compare. The first data set I found was an average life expectancy by U.S State, 
broken down by males and females. This particular data set came from the National Vital Statistic Report produced by the CDC. You can see from the
map below that average life expectancy across the U.S is highlighted by various shades of blue - with the darker states being on average higher. 
Through analysis I was able to find the 5 states with highest life expectancy were:
1.Hawaii - 81.0 years
2.California - 80.8 years
3.Minnesota - 80.5 years
4.New York - 80.5 years.
5.Connecticut - 80.4 years.

I wanted to see if there was a parallel between age expectancy and happiness by state. Below the map of the U.S represents happiness levels on a 
scale from 1 - 50, where 1 = Happiest. This data set came from a study produced by WalletHub. 
Methodology:
In order to determine the happiest states in America, WalletHub compared the 50 states across three key dimensions: 
1) Emotional & Physical Well-Being, 2) Work Environment and 3) Community & Environment. Each category was ranked on a scale 
of 100, with 100 being the happiest. After analyzing these calculations, I was able to quickly find the top 5 happiest U.S states, listed below:
1.Hawaii
2.Utah 
3.Minnesota
4.New Jersey
5.Maryland 
After comparing state happiness with average life expectancy, I wanted a more granulated insight into happiness by state broken down by males and females. 
Upon exploring, I  was able to compare and sort averages for each gender. From this I found that women have a far higher chance of living 
longer than men do. And that the lowest average LEB for females is 78 years old in Mississippi, while the highest male LEB is 78 years old in Minnesota.

Methodology / Sources: 

I used pretty clear and straight forward data to look into and sort information on average age life expectancy in the U.S, 
as well as the happiest states ranked by a number of various factors. I used pandas to neatly organize the data and analyze my findings. 
I then extracted my findings and used Datawrapper and flourish to show my findings in a visual way. 

Questions asked to consider and rate happiness by states:
What are the key ingredients to a happy life?
How important is money to people’s happiness?
What are the secrets to career contentment?
How much does where you live influence your happiness?
Considering the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, what will be the long-term effects on Americans’ happiness? 
What are some steps a person can take to protect their psychological well-being?
